## Introduction

In this project, we have a **Node.js + Express API** that manages user authentication and user CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).  
The project uses JWT tokens for authentication and Sequelize for database management.  

You can use this API to:
- Register users
- Login and generate JWT tokens
- Get user information
- Update user details
- Activate, deactivate or delete users  

To run it, simply start the server using Node.js and make HTTP requests via Postman or your frontend.
